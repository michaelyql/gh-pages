## Problem Statement

Given a string s, you can replace at most one character with any lowercase letter. Find the lexicographically smallest string that contains the most number of substrings which are palindromes.

## Number of Palindromic Substrings

To count the number of palindromic substrings in a string, we can split the palindromic strings into two: **odd length** palindromes and **even length** palindromes. The total number of palindromes is just the number of odd length palindromes plus the number of even length palindromes.

<u>Approach</u>: For each character, assume that it's the center of a palindrome. Expand outwards and increment the answer while `l >= 0 && r < s.length` and `s[l] == s[r]`.

To count palindromes of odd length (e.g. "a", "bab", "ababa"), `s[i]` will form the center. <br> To count palindromes of even length (e.g. "aa", "baab"), `s[i]` and `s[i+1]` will form the center, but only if `s[i] == s[i+1]`.

```python
def countPalindromicSubstrings(s: str):
    res = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Count odd length palindromes
        l = r = i
        while (l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]):
            res += 1
            l -= 1
            r += 1
        # Count even length palindromes
        l = i
        r = i + 1
        while (l >= 0 and r < len(s) and s[l] == s[r]):
            res += 1
            l -= 1
            r += 1
    return res
```

Alternatively, instead of incrementing the count each time you expand outwards, you can just increment `res` by the length of the longest even and odd length palindrome centered at `i`.
