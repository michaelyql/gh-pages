## Minimum Moves to Pick K Ones

You have to pick an index `aliceIndex` at the start. If it has a 1, pick it up (this doesn't cost a move). Then you have two choices: 1. change an element in the array from 0 to 1 (cannot be `aliceIndex`) at most `maxChanges` times, or 2. swap two adjacent characters such that one is a 0 and the other is a 1, and if the 1 lands on `aliceIndex` after the swap, pick it up. You can do move 2 any number of times.

## Solution: Greedy
